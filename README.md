# Android-Controlled-Robot-Car
In this project we are going to build an Android Phone controlled robot using 8051 microcontroller and Bluetooth module. The robot is designed using DC motors and the direction of DC motors will be controlled by the commands received from the android application. The status of the robot is sent back to the Android app. This project will also help for interfacing of HC-05 Bluetooth module with 8051 microcontrollers. The car is controlled by using Android mobile phone instead of any other method like buttons, gesture etc. Here we only needs to type the letter “f”, “b”, “l”, “r” and “s” in android phone to control the car in forward, backward, left, right directions and to stop respectively. So here android phone is used as transmitting device and Bluetooth module placed in car is used as receiver. Android phone will transmit command using its in-built Bluetooth to car so that it can move in the required direction like moving forward, reverse, turning left, turning right and stop.
